// Package upload provides an easy and portable way to interact with CDN,
// buckets or blobs within any cloud/local storage location. And provides
// methods to read or write or upload or delete files to blob storage on
// GCP, AWS, Azure, in-memory, local and more.
//
// It wraps `gocloud.dev/blob` (https://github.com/google/go-cloud/tree/master/blob)
// for further simplicity.
